        <h1>Plot</h1>
        <h2>The story begins with our main character Lenore, who wakes up on the shores of an unknown, mysterious location. With no memories or any idea of where she is or how she got there,he runs into Annabel Lee and together they try to find answers. The girls are being chased by unknown creatures and run into tall gates.
They end up entering a school up on a hill, which turns out to be named Nevermore Academy. This academy is run by two twin deans, and has lots of mysteries surrounding its purpose. The deans tell the girls they are actually dead, and currently in an in-between realm of sorts that gives them a chance to win another go at life.
Lenore wants nothing but answers about this strange place and the people within, and is determined to find out the reason behind her sudden unexplained presence at the academy. Annabel, on the other hand, is very calm and seems to just go with the flow. Lenore and Annabel promise to support each other, regardless of what happens when they enter!
 And with this, they are flung into the antics of this strange school.</h2>
